"The math problem is: ""What is the sum of the prime numbers less than 10?""

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all prime numbers less than 10. 
   Prime numbers are numbers that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.

2. List out the numbers less than 10: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

3. Check each number to see if it is prime:
   - 2 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 2.
   - 3 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 3.
   - 4 is not prime because it can be divided by 2.
   - 5 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 5.
   - 6 is not prime because it can be divided by 2 and 3.
   - 7 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 7.
   - 8 is not prime because it can be divided by 2 and 4.
   - 9 is not prime because it can be divided by 3.

4. The prime numbers less than 10 are: 2, 3, 5, 7.

5. Calculate the sum of these prime numbers: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Therefore, the sum of the prime numbers less than 10 is 17.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
"The math problem is: ""What is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16?""

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 30 and 40**

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. To find the LCM of 30 and 40, we need to list the multiples of each number:

Multiples of 30: 30, 60, 90, 120,...
Multiples of 40: 40, 80, 120,...

The first number that appears in both lists is 120, so the LCM of 30 and 40 is 120.

**Step 2: Check if the LCM is a multiple of 16**

We need to check if 120 is a multiple of 16. To do this, we can divide 120 by 16:

120 ÷ 16 = 7.5

Since 120 is not a multiple of 16 (the result is not an integer), we can conclude that 120 is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16.

Therefore, the final answer is 120.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
"The math problem is: ""Eleven is the fifth prime number. What is the tenth prime number?""

To solve this problem, we need to find the sequence of prime numbers and identify the tenth one. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. First, we need to understand what prime numbers are. Prime numbers are numbers that are greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 and themselves without leaving a remainder. Examples of prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

2. We are given that 11 is the fifth prime number. This means that we can start counting prime numbers from the beginning: 2 (first prime), 3 (second prime), 5 (third prime), 7 (fourth prime), 11 (fifth prime).

3. To find the tenth prime number, we need to continue counting prime numbers from where we left off: 13 (sixth prime), 17 (seventh prime), 19 (eighth prime), 23 (ninth prime), 29 (tenth prime).

4. Therefore, the tenth prime number is 29.

So, the solution to the problem is 29, which is the tenth prime number in the sequence of prime numbers.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
"The math problem is to find the reciprocal of the common fraction form of the repeating decimal 0.2̄.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Convert the repeating decimal 0.2̄ into a fraction.**

Let x = 0.2̄. This means x = 0.2222...

To convert this decimal into a fraction, multiply both sides by 10 to shift the decimal point:
10x = 2.2222...

Now, subtract the original x from this equation:
10x - x = 2.2222... - 0.2222...

This simplifies to:
9x = 2

Solving for x, we get:
x = 2/9

So, the common fraction form of 0.2̄ is 2/9.

**Step 2: Find the reciprocal of 2/9.**

The reciprocal of a fraction a/b is b/a. Therefore, the reciprocal of 2/9 is 9/2.

Thus, the reciprocal of the common fraction form of 0.2̄ is 9/2.

The final answer is 9/2.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
"The math problem is: What is the greatest three-digit multiple of 19?

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest three-digit number that is divisible by 19. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the largest three-digit number, which is 999.

Step 2: Find the largest integer less than or equal to 999 that is divisible by 19. To do this, we divide 999 by 19.

999 ÷ 19 = 52.5789 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a number in this context, we take the whole part of the result, which is 52.

Step 3: Multiply the result from Step 2 by 19 to get the largest multiple of 19 that is less than or equal to 999.

52 × 19 = 988

Therefore, the greatest three-digit multiple of 19 is 988.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
"Let's break down the math problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:** 
The number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. We need to find the value of $n$.

**Step 1: List all prime numbers between 20 and 30.**
To solve this problem, we first need to identify all prime numbers between 20 and 30. Prime numbers are numbers that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. 

The numbers between 20 and 30 are: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Out of these numbers, the prime numbers are: 23 and 29.

**Step 2: Check which of these numbers leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.**
Now, we need to check which of these prime numbers leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.

For 23: 23 ÷ 8 = 2 remainder 7 (not 5)
For 29: 29 ÷ 8 = 3 remainder 5 (this is the number we are looking for)

Therefore, the value of $n$ is 29.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
"The math problem is to find the 100th letter in a repeating pattern of ""ABC"".

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Identify the length of the repeating pattern: The pattern ""ABC"" has a length of 3.

2. Determine the position of the 100th letter within one cycle of the pattern: To do this, we divide 100 by the length of the pattern (3) and find the remainder. This is equivalent to finding the remainder when 100 is divided by 3, which can be calculated using the modulo operation (100 % 3).

   100 ÷ 3 = 33 with a remainder of 1.

   So, the position of the 100th letter within one cycle is actually the remainder, which is 1.

3. Map the position to the corresponding letter: Since the remainder is 1, it corresponds to the first letter in the pattern, which is 'A'. However, in this case, the remainder 1 means the 100th letter is the first letter in the pattern. But if we list the pattern out and count to the 100th letter, we get:

   ABC (1st set), ABC (2nd set),... ABC (33rd set), A (100th letter is A in the 34th set). But A in the 34th set is actually the first letter in the set, but that's not what we want. What we want is the last letter in the 33rd set (the 99th letter) and the next one is the 100th letter which is A in the 34th set which is wrong.

   Because 100 % 3 is 1. However if we list the pattern we get: 
   
   ABCABC...ABC (33 sets) and we are looking for the 100th letter which is C.

   So the correct count is 
   
   (ABC... 33 sets * 3 letters in each set = 99 letters and the next one is the 100th letter which is C).

   So the 100th letter is C.

Therefore, the 100th letter in the pattern is C.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
"Let's break down the math problem step by step.

**Problem:** Find the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7.

**Step 1: Understand the condition**
We need to find an integer that, when divided by 7, leaves a remainder of 3. This means the number can be expressed as 7k + 3, where k is an integer.

**Step 2: Start from the largest integer less than 74**
We start from 73, which is the largest integer less than 74.

**Step 3: Check if the number satisfies the condition**
We check if 73 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. To do this, we divide 73 by 7 and find the remainder. 73 ÷ 7 = 10 with a remainder of 3. However, we made a mistake, 73 ÷ 7 = 10 with a remainder of 3 is incorrect. The correct calculation is: 73 ÷ 7 = 10 with a remainder of 3 is incorrect, the correct remainder is 3 is incorrect.

**Step 4: Decrement the number and check again**
Since 73 doesn't satisfy the condition, we decrement the number to 72 and check again. We repeat this process until we find a number that satisfies the condition.

Let's try a few more numbers:

* 72 ÷ 7 = 10 with a remainder of 2 (not 3)
* 71 ÷ 7 = 10 with a remainder of 1 (not 3)
* 70 ÷ 7 = 10 with a remainder of 0 (not 3)
* 69 ÷ 7 = 9 with a remainder of 6 (not 3)
* 68 ÷ 7 = 9 with a remainder of 5 (not 3)
* 67 ÷ 7 = 9 with a remainder of 4 (not 3)
* 66 ÷ 7 = 9 with a remainder of 3 (correct!)

**Step 5: Find the largest integer that satisfies the condition**
We found that 66 is the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7.

Therefore, the final answer is 66.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
"The math problem is: What is the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by 3 and divisible by 6?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the largest three-digit number.
The largest three-digit number is 999.

Step 2: Check if this number is divisible by 6. 
To check if a number is divisible by 6, we need to check if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. 
A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). 
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

999 is not divisible by 6 because it is not divisible by 2 (its last digit is 9, which is odd).

Step 3: Decrement the number until we find a number that is divisible by 6.
We start with 999 and decrement by 1 until we find a number that is divisible by 6.
The first number we find is 996, which is divisible by 6.

Step 4: Verify that the number is indeed the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by 3 and 6.
996 is indeed the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6.

"Let's break down the math problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
When Joyce counts the pennies in her bank by fives, she has one left over. When she counts them by threes, there are two left over. What is the least possible number of pennies in the bank?

**Step 1: Understand the conditions**
We have two conditions:

1. When the number of pennies is divided by 5, the remainder is 1.
2. When the number of pennies is divided by 3, the remainder is 2.

**Step 2: Represent the conditions mathematically**
We can represent these conditions using modular arithmetic:

1. x ≡ 1 (mod 5)
2. x ≡ 2 (mod 3)

Here, x is the number of pennies, and ""≡"" means ""is congruent to"".

**Step 3: Solve the system of congruences**
We need to find the smallest number x that satisfies both conditions. This is a classic problem of finding the least common multiple with specific remainders, which can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

**Step 4: Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem**
The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if we have a system of congruences:

x ≡ a1 (mod n1)
x ≡ a2 (mod n2)

where gcd(n1, n2) = 1 (i.e., n1 and n2 are coprime), then there exists a unique solution modulo n1n2.

In our case, n1 = 5 and n2 = 3 are coprime, so we can apply the theorem.

**Step 5: Find the solution**
Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find the smallest number x that satisfies both conditions. This involves finding the least common multiple of 5 and 3, which is 15, and then finding the smallest number x that satisfies both congruences modulo 15.

**Step 6: Calculate the solution**
After applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find that the smallest number x that satisfies both conditions is x = 11.

Therefore, the least possible number of pennies in the bank is 11.",gpt-4o-and-llama3.1-405b-expansao
