"To solve the problem of finding the reciprocal of the common fraction form of \(0.\overline{2}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Decimal**: The notation \(0.\overline{2}\) represents a repeating decimal, which means it is equal to \(0.22222...\) where the digit '2' repeats indefinitely.

2. **Setting Up an Equation**: We can let \(x\) represent the repeating decimal:
   \[
   x = 0.\overline{2}
   \]
   This means:
   \[
   x = 0.22222...
   \]

3. **Eliminating the Repeating Part**: To convert this repeating decimal into a fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10. This shifts the decimal point one place to the right:
   \[
   10x = 2.22222...
   \]

4. **Subtracting the Original Equation**: Now, we can subtract the original equation from this new equation to eliminate the repeating part:
   \[
   10x - x = 2.22222... - 0.22222...
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   9x = 2
   \]

5. **Solving for \(x\)**: Now, we can solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 9:
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{9}
   \]
   Thus, we have converted \(0.\overline{2}\) into the fraction \(\frac{2}{9}\).

6. **Finding the Reciprocal**: The next step is to find the reciprocal of the fraction \(\frac{2}{9}\). The reciprocal of a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) is given by \(\frac{b}{a}\). Therefore, the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{9}\) is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{2}
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: The final answer, which is the reciprocal of the common fraction form of \(0.\overline{2}\), is:
   \[
   \boxed{\frac{9}{2}}
   \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find a prime number \( p \) such that \( q = 11p + 1 \) is also a prime number. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define the relationship
We start with the equation:
\[
q = 11p + 1
\]
Here, both \( p \) and \( q \) must be prime numbers.

### Step 2: Check small prime numbers for \( p \)
We will test small prime numbers for \( p \) to see if the resulting \( q \) is also prime.

1. **For \( p = 2 \)**:
   \[
   q = 11 \times 2 + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23 \quad (\text{which is prime})
   \]

2. **For \( p = 3 \)**:
   \[
   q = 11 \times 3 + 1 = 33 + 1 = 34 \quad (\text{which is not prime})
   \]

3. **For \( p = 5 \)**:
   \[
   q = 11 \times 5 + 1 = 55 + 1 = 56 \quad (\text{which is not prime})

4. **For \( p = 7 \)**:
   \[
   q = 11 \times 7 + 1 = 77 + 1 = 78 \quad (\text{which is not prime})
   \]

5. **For \( p = 11 \)**:
   \[
   q = 11 \times 11 + 1 = 121 + 1 = 122 \quad (\text{which is not prime})
   \]

6. **For \( p = 13 \)**:
   \[
   q = 11 \times 13 + 1 = 143 + 1 = 144 \quad (\text{which is not prime})
   \]

7. **For \( p = 17 \)**:
   \[
   q = 11 \times 17 + 1 = 187 + 1 = 188 \quad (\text{which is not prime})

After checking these small prime numbers, we find that the only prime \( p \) that results in \( q \) being prime is when \( p = 2 \), which gives us \( q = 23 \).

Thus, the value of \( q \) is:
\[

The final answer is 23.",gpt-4o-mini
"Let's go through the problem step-by-step without any code, focusing on clarity and coherence.

### Problem Statement
Bryan has some 3 cent stamps and some 4 cent stamps. We need to find the least number of stamps he can combine to make a total of 33 cents.

### Step 1: Define Variables
We will define:
- \( x \): the number of 3 cent stamps
- \( y \): the number of 4 cent stamps

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
The total value of the stamps can be expressed with the equation:
\[
3x + 4y = 33
\]
This equation states that the total value from the 3 cent stamps and the 4 cent stamps must equal 33 cents.

### Step 3: Rearrange the Equation
To express \( y \) in terms of \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
\[
4y = 33 - 3x
\]
\[
y = \frac{33 - 3x}{4}
\]
This equation tells us how many 4 cent stamps we need for a given number of 3 cent stamps.

### Step 4: Ensure \( y \) is a Non-Negative Integer
For \( y \) to be a valid solution, it must be a non-negative integer. This means:
1. \( 33 - 3x \) must be non-negative (i.e., \( 33 - 3x \geq 0 \)).
2. \( 33 - 3x \) must be divisible by 4.

### Step 5: Check Values of \( x \)
We will check different values of \( x \) starting from 0 and see if we can find corresponding values of \( y \) that meet the criteria.

- **For \( x = 0 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(0)}{4} = \frac{33}{4} = 8.25 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 1 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(1)}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 2 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(2)}{4} = \frac{27}{4} = 6.75 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 3 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(3)}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \quad (\text{valid, } y \text{ is an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 4 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(4)}{4} = \frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 5 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(5)}{4} = \frac{18}{4} = 4.5 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 6 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(6)}{4} = \frac{15}{4} = 3.75 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 7 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(7)}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \quad (\text{valid})
  \]

- **For \( x = 8 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(8)}{4} = \frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 9 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(9)}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 10 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(10)}{4} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- **For \( x = 11 \)**:
  \[
  y = \frac{33 - 3(11)}{4} = \frac{0}{4} = 0 \quad (\text{valid})
  \]

### Step 6: Calculate Total Stamps
Now we have valid combinations:
1. \( (x, y) = (3, 6) \) → Total stamps = \( 3 + 6 = 9 \)
2. \( (x, y) = (7, 3) \) → Total stamps = \( 7 + 3 = 10 \)
3. \( (x, y) = (11, 0) \) → Total stamps = \( 11 + 0 = 11 \)

The combination with the least number of stamps is \( (3, 6) \), which gives us a total of 9 stamps.

### Final Answer
The least number of stamps Bryan can combine to make 33 cents is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve the problem of finding the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16, we can break it down into several clear steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 30 and 40

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. We can find the LCM using the formula:

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]

where GCD is the greatest common divisor.

### Step 2: Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 30 and 40

To find the GCD, we can either list the factors of each number or use the Euclidean algorithm. 

- The factors of 30 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30
- The factors of 40 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40

The common factors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The greatest of these is 10, so:

\[
\text{GCD}(30, 40) = 10
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the LCM using the GCD

Now that we have the GCD, we can calculate the LCM:

\[
\text{LCM}(30, 40) = \frac{30 \times 40}{10} = \frac{1200}{10} = 120
\]

### Step 4: Find the smallest multiple of the LCM that is not a multiple of 16

Now we need to check the multiples of 120 to find the smallest one that is not a multiple of 16. 

- The first multiple of 120 is 120 itself. 
- To check if 120 is a multiple of 16, we divide 120 by 16:

\[
120 \div 16 = 7.5
\]

Since 7.5 is not an integer, 120 is not a multiple of 16.

### Conclusion

Thus, the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16 is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"To solve the problem of finding the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25, we can follow these steps:

1. **Division**: First, we need to determine how many times 25 fits into 2007. This can be done by performing the division \( 2007 \div 25 \). 

2. **Integer Part of the Quotient**: The result of this division will give us a quotient, which may be a decimal. We only need the integer part of this quotient, which tells us how many whole times 25 can fit into 2007. 

3. **Multiplication**: Next, we multiply this integer quotient by 25. This gives us the largest multiple of 25 that is less than or equal to 2007.

4. **Subtraction**: Finally, we subtract this product from 2007 to find the remainder. The remainder is what is left over after we have taken out all the multiples of 25 from 2007.

Now, let's go through the calculations step-by-step:

- **Step 1**: Calculate \( 2007 \div 25 \). Performing this division gives us approximately 80.28. The integer part of this quotient is 80.

- **Step 2**: Multiply the integer part (80) by 25. So, \( 80 \times 25 = 2000 \).

- **Step 3**: Subtract this product from 2007. Thus, \( 2007 - 2000 = 7 \).

Therefore, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is 7.

"To solve the problem of finding the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding Division and Remainders**: When we divide one number by another, the result can be expressed in terms of a quotient and a remainder. The remainder is what is left over after the division. For example, if we divide 10 by 3, the quotient is 3 (since 3 times 3 is 9) and the remainder is 1 (since 10 - 9 = 1).

2. **Using the Modulus Operation**: The remainder can be found using the modulus operation. In mathematical terms, if we have two numbers, \( a \) (the dividend) and \( b \) (the divisor), the remainder of \( a \) divided by \( b \) is denoted as \( a \mod b \).

3. **Applying the Modulus to Our Problem**: In this case, we want to find \( 369,963 \mod 6 \). This means we need to divide 369,963 by 6 and find the remainder.

4. **Performing the Division**: We can perform the division:
   - First, we divide 369,963 by 6. 
   - The quotient will be the largest whole number that can be multiplied by 6 without exceeding 369,963.

5. **Calculating the Remainder**: After finding the quotient, we can multiply it back by 6 and subtract that product from 369,963 to find the remainder:
   - Let’s say the quotient is \( q \). Then, we calculate \( 6 \times q \) and subtract it from 369,963:
   - Remainder = \( 369,963 - (6 \times q) \).

6. **Finding the Result**: After performing the calculations, we find that the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6 is 3.

7. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the final answer is that the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6 is \( \boxed{3} \). 

This step-by-step approach allows us to understand how to find the remainder using division and the modulus operation.",gpt-4o-mini
"To solve the problem of finding the remainder when \( (99)(101) \) is divided by 9, we can use modular arithmetic, which simplifies calculations involving remainders.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Find the remainder of 99 when divided by 9**:
   - We perform the division \( 99 \div 9 \). The result is 11, which means 9 goes into 99 exactly 11 times with no remainder.
   - Therefore, \( 99 \mod 9 = 0 \).

2. **Find the remainder of 101 when divided by 9**:
   - We perform the division \( 101 \div 9 \). The result is 11 with a remainder of 2, since \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) and \( 101 - 99 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, \( 101 \mod 9 = 2 \).

3. **Combine the results using the properties of modular arithmetic**:
   - We can now find the product \( (99)(101) \mod 9 \) using the remainders we calculated:
   \[
   (99)(101) \mod 9 = (0)(2) \mod 9
   \]
   - Since multiplying by zero gives zero, we have:
   \[
   (0)(2) = 0
   \]
   - Thus, \( 0 \mod 9 = 0 \).

   - The remainder when \( (99)(101) \) is divided by 9 is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is that the remainder is \( \boxed{0} \).",gpt-4o-mini
"Let's simplify and clarify the explanation of the math problem step-by-step to make it more engaging and easier to follow.

### Problem Statement
We need to find a two-digit positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \) is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

### Step 1: Understanding the Condition
The condition states that \( n - 1 \) must be a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This means we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.

### Step 2: Finding the LCM
To find the LCM, we look at the prime factorization of each number:
- \( 2 = 2^1 \)
- \( 3 = 3^1 \)
- \( 4 = 2^2 \)
- \( 5 = 5^1 \)
- \( 6 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \)

Next, we take the highest power of each prime:
- For \( 2 \), the highest power is \( 2^2 \) (from 4).
- For \( 3 \), the highest power is \( 3^1 \).
- For \( 5 \), the highest power is \( 5^1 \).

Now we calculate the LCM:
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 5 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation
Since \( n - 1 \) must be a multiple of 60, we can express this as:
\[
n - 1 = k \times 60 \quad \text{for some integer } k
\]
This leads to:
\[
n = k \times 60 + 1
\]

### Step 4: Finding Two-Digit Values for \( n \)
We want \( n \) to be a two-digit number, which means:
- The smallest two-digit number is 10.
- The largest two-digit number is 99.

Now we set up inequalities to find valid values for \( k \):
1. For the smallest two-digit number:
   \[
   k \times 60 + 1 \geq 10 \implies k \times 60 \geq 9 \implies k \geq \frac{9}{60} \approx 0.15
   \]
   Thus, the smallest integer \( k \) can be 1.

2. For the largest two-digit number:
   \[
   k \times 60 + 1 < 100 \implies k \times 60 < 99 \implies k < \frac{98}{60} \approx 1.63
   \]
   Thus, the largest integer \( k \) can also be 1.

### Step 5: Calculating \( n \)
Now substituting \( k = 1 \):
\[
n = 1 \times 60 + 1 = 61
\]

### Conclusion
The only two-digit positive integer that is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is \( 61 \).

Thus, the final answer is \( \boxed{61} \).

     - \( 36 \mod 8 = 4 \) (not valid)
     - \( 42 \mod 8 = 2 \) (valid)

   - The valid candidates so far are \( 42 \) and \( 66 \).

4. **Check the condition \( m \equiv 2 \mod 5 \)**:

"To solve the problem of how many pieces of candy could be left over when Grady distributes \( x \) pieces of candy evenly among nine Halloween bags, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding Distribution**: When distributing \( x \) pieces of candy among 9 bags, each bag will receive a certain number of whole pieces of candy. The number of pieces each bag receives can be calculated using the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the division of \( x \) by 9. This is represented mathematically as:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{x}{9} \right\rfloor

2. **Calculating Remainder**: After distributing the candy, there may be some pieces left over. The number of leftover pieces can be found using the modulus operation, which gives the remainder when \( x \) is divided by 9. This is expressed as:
   \[
   r = x \mod 9
   \]
   where \( r \) is the remainder.

3. **Possible Values for Remainder**: The remainder \( r \) can take on values from 0 to 8. However, since the problem states that some candy was left over, we cannot have \( r = 0 \). Therefore, the possible values for \( r \) are:
