"Let's break down the math problem step by step.

**Problem:** What is the greatest number of Sundays that can occur in the first 49 days of a year?

**Step 1: Understand the problem**
The problem is asking us to find the maximum number of Sundays that can occur in the first 49 days of a year.

**Step 2: Determine the maximum number of Sundays**
Since every 7 days is a Sunday, we can divide 49 by 7 to find the maximum number of Sundays that can occur in the first 49 days of a year.

**Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of Sundays**
To calculate the maximum number of Sundays, we divide 49 by 7, which gives us 7.

**Step 4: Consider the remaining days**
After calculating the maximum number of Sundays, we need to consider if there are any remaining days that could potentially be a Sunday. Since 49 is exactly divisible by 7, there are no remaining days.

**Step 5: Determine the final answer**
Since we have found the maximum number of Sundays and considered any remaining days, we can now determine the final answer. The maximum number of Sundays that can occur in the first 49 days of a year is 7.

Therefore, the final answer is 7.",Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
"Let's break down the math problem step by step.

**Problem:** A whole number, N, is chosen so that N/3 is strictly between 7.5 and 8. We need to find the value of N.

**Step 1: Understand the constraints for N**
We are given that N/3 is strictly between 7.5 and 8. This means 7.5 < N/3 < 8. In other words, N/3 must be greater than 7.5 but less than 8.

**Step 2: Convert the inequalities to find the range for N**
To isolate N, we multiply all parts of the inequality by 3. This gives us 7.5*3 < N < 8*3. By multiplying the inequality by 3, we can get rid of the fraction and find the range of values for N.

**Step 3: Calculate the range for N**
Now, let's calculate the values: 7.5*3 = 22.5 and 8*3 = 24. This means 22.5 < N < 24. So, N must be greater than 22.5 but less than 24.

**Step 4: Identify the whole number N within the range**
Since N must be a whole number, we need to find the whole number between 22.5 and 24. The only whole number in this range is 23.

Therefore, the value of N is 23.",Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
"The math problem is to find the greatest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Understand the problem**
We are looking for the largest three-digit number that can be divided by 13 without leaving a remainder.

**Step 2: Determine the largest three-digit number**
The largest three-digit number is 999.

**Step 3: Find the largest multiple of 13 less than or equal to 999**
To find this, we divide 999 by 13. 

999 ÷ 13 = 76.846...

Since we can't have a fraction of a number in this context, we take the whole part of the result, which is 76.

**Step 4: Multiply the result by 13**
Now, we multiply 76 by 13 to find the largest multiple of 13 that is less than or equal to 999.

76 × 13 = 988

Therefore, the greatest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13 is 988.",Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
"The math problem is to find the greatest three-digit multiple of 19.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Understand the problem**
We need to find the greatest three-digit multiple of 19.

**Step 2: Determine the upper and lower limits for three-digit numbers**
The smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest is 999.

**Step 3: Find the largest multiple of 19 within the three-digit range**
To find the largest multiple of 19 that is less than or equal to 999, we can divide 999 by 19 and take the whole number part of the result (ignoring any remainder).

**Step 4: Calculate the greatest three-digit multiple of 19**
 Divide 999 by 19: 999 ÷ 19 = 52.5789 (approximately)
 Take the whole number part: 52
 Multiply by 19 to get the largest multiple: 52 × 19 = 988
 However, since 988 is not the largest multiple less than or equal to 999, we know 52 is the correct multiplier but we need to verify if 53 is also a valid multiplier.
 53 × 19 = 1007, which is more than 999. 
 So, the largest multiplier is 52 but we should use the multiplier 51 to get the largest three-digit number.
 51 × 19 = 969

Therefore, the greatest three-digit multiple of 19 is 969.",Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
