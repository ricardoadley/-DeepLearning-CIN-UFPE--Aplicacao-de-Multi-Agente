"The math problem is to find the reciprocal of the common fraction form of the repeating decimal 0.222222....

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Understand the problem**
The problem asks us to find the reciprocal of the common fraction form of the repeating decimal 0.222222....

**Step 2: Convert the repeating decimal to a fraction**
Let's denote the repeating decimal as x. We can write it as x = 0.222222....

**Step 3: Multiply the decimal by 10 to shift the repeating part**
Multiplying x by 10 shifts the repeating part one digit to the left, resulting in 10x = 2.222222....

**Step 4: Subtract the original decimal from the shifted decimal**
Subtracting x from 10x eliminates the repeating part: 10x - x = 2.222222... - 0.222222....
This simplifies to 9x = 2.

**Step 5: Solve for x**
Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives x = 2/9.

**Step 6: Find the reciprocal of the fraction**
The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator. Therefore, the reciprocal of 2/9 is 9/2.

The final answer is 9/2.",Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
"Let's break down the math problem step by step.

**Problem:** One more than 11 times a certain prime number p is another prime number q. We need to find the value of q.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**
The problem states that 11 times a prime number p, plus 1, equals another prime number q. Mathematically, this can be represented as 11p + 1 = q.

**Step 2: Determine the possible values of p**
Since p is a prime number, we can start by trying the smallest prime numbers to see if 11p + 1 results in another prime number.

**Step 3: Try p = 2**
We'll start by trying p = 2, the smallest prime number. If p = 2, then 11p + 1 = 11(2) + 1 = 23.

**Step 4: Verify if 23 is a prime number**
We need to check if 23 is a prime number. A prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1.

To verify, we can check the divisibility of 23 by all numbers from 2 to 22 (since 23 is not divisible by 1). If 23 is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number.

Upon checking, we find that 23 is not divisible by any number between 2 and 22. Therefore, 23 is indeed a prime number.

**Conclusion:** Since 11p + 1 = 23, and 23 is a prime number, we have found the solution. The value of q is 23.

The final answer is: 23.",Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
"Let's break down the math problem step by step.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**
Bryan has two types of stamps: 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps. We need to find the least number of stamps he can combine to get a total value of 33 cents.

**Step 2: Analyze possible combinations**
We can start by trying to find a combination of 3 cent and 4 cent stamps that adds up to 33 cents. To do this, we can try different numbers of 4 cent stamps and see if the remaining amount can be made up with 3 cent stamps.

**Step 3: Find the combination**
Let's try using 8 stamps of 4 cents each, which would be 8 x 4 = 32 cents. This leaves 1 cent remaining, which cannot be made up with 3 cent stamps.

Next, let's try using 7 stamps of 4 cents each, which would be 7 x 4 = 28 cents. This leaves 5 cents remaining, which also cannot be made up with 3 cent stamps.

Now, let's try using 6 stamps of 4 cents each, which would be 6 x 4 = 24 cents. This leaves 9 cents remaining, which can be made up with 3 stamps of 3 cents each.

However, we can also try using 5 stamps of 4 cents each, which would be 5 x 4 = 20 cents. This leaves 13 cents remaining, which cannot be made up with 3 cent stamps.

Next, let's try using 4 stamps of 4 cents each, which would be 4 x 4 = 16 cents. This leaves 17 cents remaining, which cannot be made up with 3 cent stamps.

Now, let's try using 3 stamps of 4 cents each, which would be 3 x 4 = 12 cents. This leaves 21 cents remaining, which can be made up with 7 stamps of 3 cents each.

However, this combination uses a total of 10 stamps (3 stamps of 4 cents each and 7 stamps of 3 cents each), which is not the least number of stamps.

Next, let's try using 2 stamps of 4 cents each, which would be 2 x 4 = 8 cents. This leaves 25 cents remaining, which cannot be made up with 3 cent stamps.

Now, let's try using 1 stamp of 4 cents, which would be 1 x 4 = 4 cents. This leaves 29 cents remaining, which cannot be made up with 3 cent stamps.

Finally, let's try using 0 stamps of 4 cents each. In this case, we would need to use 11 stamps of 3 cents each to make up the total amount of 33 cents.

However, we can also try using 8 stamps of 3 cents each and 3 stamps of 4 cents each (3 x 3 = 9 cents and 3 x 4 = 12 cents, then 9 + 12 = 21 cents, and 8 x 3 = 24 cents, then 24 + 9 = 33 cents). But 8 + 3 is 11 stamps.

But if we use 3 stamps of 4 cents each and 7 stamps of 3 cents each, we have 9 stamps.

However, we can also try using 9 stamps of 3 cents each and 0 stamps of 4 cents each (9 x 3 = 27 cents and we are missing 6 cents), then if we use 1 stamp of 4 cents and 1 stamp of 3 cents, we have 2 more stamps and a total of 11 stamps.

However, if we use 3 stamps of 4 cents each and 6 stamps of 3 cents each, we have 9 stamps.

**Step 4: Find the least number of stamps**
Based on the analysis above, the least number of stamps Bryan can combine to get a total value of 33 cents is 9 stamps (3 stamps of 4 cents each and 6 stamps of 3 cents each).

The final answer is: 9",Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct
